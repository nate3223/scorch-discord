Scorch is a dynamic Discord server bot which tracks game server information, and allows for members within the server to control various aspects of the server via customisable, modular buttons.

With Scorch, you can add multiple servers to track and display real time server data, in the comfort of your community's Discord server!

Discord server administators are able to utilise Scorch's in-built dynamic dashboard, which allows for quick and easy configuration, all without having to leave discord! Scorch also lets you create custom buttons! These buttons allow users to set a destination address, which sends an HTTP request to the address when a user presses the button! This allows for you to create useful buttons that can directly iterface with a game server. For example, you may want to create a button which when pressed, tells the server to restart.
